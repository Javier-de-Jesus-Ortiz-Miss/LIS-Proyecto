Fist of all, we decided to organize the repository in a better way to avoid having merge porblems and for the better understanding of it. We created the structure of the second delivery with folders and documents from the last activitie and merged it into our personal branches. Only the leader of the team is able to accept pull request

After that we established the rules to interact with the repository:

1. Every member must have their personal branch in a local folder
2. To acomplish the activities assingned every member works locally and will push to the remote branch during the meetings of the team
3. Every activity has a designed folder stablished in ...
4. The merge of all the personal branches with the delivery is done during the last meeting with all the members verifying the information

We did a first task divition, and made group works to accomplish the 3 areas we focused on, the repository, the artifacts and the interfases; after the firts meeting to check progress we decided to merg the group of the repository in to the other groups becouse of the complexity them.
