### Generic Competencies

| <font color="red">Generic Competencies</font>                            | Description                                                                                                                     |

|1. <font color="green">Team collaboration </font>                            |Trough this project our understanding of what is necessary for true team collaboration, and how to achieve those steps has expanded a lot.  Regular meetings, constant exchange of ideas, evaluation of our process, regular co-evaluation of our work, communicating trough disagreements and making sure we all had the same understanding of the product through all the different iterations were things that weren’t truly in our past team experiences, since the projects only consisted in dividing the workload and checking it when it’s done. In conclusion this project´s iterative nature allowed us to experience and gain knowledge in many different aspects of team collaboration that are new to us, setting a solid foundation for the development of the team collaboration competency in our career. |
|2. <font color="green">Time management </font>                                |Like we discussed in process (link) we designed a workflow that divided the last sprint into four weeks, each which a different set of tasks and enough time to finish it and then make the corrections issued by the person responsible of checking the task. Comparing our current process with the one how we did it in the first sprint, where the only real deadline was the one set by our teacher, it is evident that trough the development of this project we have improved a lot when it comes to time management.  |
|3. <font color="green">Clear and precise communication </font>                | Coming up with functionalities for our project and deciding if they were going to be in the final product allowed to put into practice our soft skills, since we had to properly communicate to the team why we thought the idea should stay or go. We also aimed for assertive communication when making corrections, aiming for constructive and clear criticism, and avoiding destructive criticism. |
|4. <font color="green">Adaptable to changes </font>                           | Since we changed our process each sprint to assure quality and timely results, adaptation was key in our team. Even though some of the team members preferred a more flexible schedule they adapted to the new process which was crucial for an adequate completion of our project. We also had to adapt to the many different iterations of our product idea.

|1. Software development                     |While it is evident that real life software development has a lot more complexity, stakes, and obstacles, we still believe that this first encounter of developing a software idea and being able to portray it in interfaces allowed us to experience many of different situations that come with the initial stages of software development. It also helped us understand that many aspects that from the outside seem trivial, are in fact very complex and shouldn’t be undermined such as when a task is done and how to properly delimit a software idea. All of this at the very least, gave us a wider understanding of what developing this competency truly entails.        |
|2. Software process management | As mentioned before, and as we described in the process(link) with each sprint we got better at applying at carrying out the tasks in a systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable way, as well as making sure that the results had quality and were delivered in a timely manner. |
