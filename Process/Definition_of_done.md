# Definition of done 

As a team we found this concept very interesting since we now realize that we were partially carrying it out when making revisions, since we were checking certain criteria to determine if the product was done or corrections and/or additions were necessary. However, we never formalized the definition which we now realize would have been ideal since it would have guaranteed that all of the criteria was eventually met and it would have given the team a more clear idea of what their product needed to contain in order to be considered as done.

Here is our formalization of the two main types of tasks that were carried out in this sprint:

## For documentation tasks:
•	Grammatical correctness 
•	It’s in English 
•	Accordance to the rubric
•	Accordance to the current version of the project
•	Properly formatted in markdown

## For interfaces:
•	Accordance to the agreed upon color palette.
•	Components like buttons or back arrows are the same as the rest of the project.
•	Minimalist design
•	Interactive parts are clearly conveyed.
•	No leftover placeholders from wireframes
•	All components are inside a frame. 
•	All text is in English and appropriate for the product.
