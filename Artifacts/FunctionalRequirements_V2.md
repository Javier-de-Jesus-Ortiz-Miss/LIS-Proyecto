# Functional Requirements

**1 - User Registration / Sign In**

From the login screen, the user can enter an email and password that have been previously registered in the system, which will be validated by the system and allow the user to access their profile. The user can also choose to register a new profile from the login screen, and the system will open a tab requesting information such as name, email, password, birthday, gender, country and city. The information will be saved, and the user can enter their email and password to access their profile.

**2 - Profile Customization**

In the profile customization section of the user's profile, the user can customize fields such as genres of interest, instruments they play, payment, profile description, profile picture, and videos. The first time a session is initiated, the system will automatically display the profile customization interface, which must be completed to access the following interfaces.

**3 - Project Creation**

From the project feed, the user can click the "New Project" button, which allows them to create a project with a name, genre, city, description, profile picture, video, and initial members. It will also indicate what profile characteristics are required to complete the project. Users who match the profile criteria will see the project in the project feed. The project creator is its default administrator.

**4 - Adding Videos to the Profile and project**

Users can add videos to their profiles or project with a brief description. They must also specify which of these videos can be viewed by other users in the main section in the case of profile a maximum of 3, and in the case of project only one.

**5 - Viewing Similar Projects and Profiles**

From the main page, users can:

In the "Users" section, view profiles similar to theirs, which may be of interest based on tags and the city. Users can scroll down to see more profiles.
In the "Projects" section, view recommended projects based on their tags, the city, and the project's requirements. Users can scroll down to see more projects.

**6 - Match between Users**

A user can send a match request to another user or a project by clicking on their profile picture, which will redirect them to the profile where they can press the "Match" button (if they require more information) or simply swipe the video to the right. The user who receives the notification or the project administrator will receive the match notification in the Chat section, where they can choose to accept or reject it. When someone is accepted into a project, a match is automatically made between them and the group members.

**7 - Chat**

The system includes a chat section that allows users to communicate through private channels. User-to-user chats are limited to 2 users per channel, and project chats can involve 1 or more users. Project chats are managed by the project administrator, and removing someone from the group will automatically eject them from the project. Similarly, the role of administrator can be transferred to another project member.

**8 - Search in Different Sections**

Users can use the search feature from various areas to search for specific items by entering a name or selecting different filters. The different sections and their respective filters are as follows:

Users section: instruments, technical roles, proximity and payment.
Projects section: requirements, genres and proximity.
