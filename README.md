### Value proposal
#### Videos to share your abilities
Our app offers the posibility to upload videos to help the user easily determine and show what they are good at and what they are looking for, this is made with the idea to help the persons that want to start a band to swiftly find the persons that they want. To complement the video we also allow to pair it with some text that you can use to put a description of your abilities and also add your cv, as an adittional option for people who are more experimented in working with a band or creating by themselves. All this is made with the objective of making easier to find persons and easier to connect with other people that look for your abilities.

#### Sell and buy objects or services
It also implements the ability to let the users post things that they want to sell or offer as a rent service; I want to clarify that the app will provide the ability to post and chat with the persos that offer the services and its made with that in mind, so currently we have not in our plans adding a method in which the users can exchange money.

#### Chat system
Because of that we also implement a messaging system that will help the users swiftly make contact with other persons to organize for buying something, selling or playing together. 

#### Search and filters for improved search
The search option will give the users the power to see only what they want, this tool will show results for things that are being sold, persons, and musicians with that abilities; if you don't want to see certain things, there also the option to filter the results, so you will only see the things that you select.
