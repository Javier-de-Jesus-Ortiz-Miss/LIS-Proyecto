### Product description

The software product is a comprehensive platform that connects enthusiasts and individuals from the music industry in a collaborative environment. This allows for agility in musician recruitment, creation of groups, and organization of musical events. Additionally, it enables the purchase, sale, or rental of musical products, with parameters tailored to the preferences of both the seller and the interested party.

<a  Users or Clients id="item3"></a>
### Users/Clients 
Our main objective is to help people so that they can interact with musicians or expand their musical knowledge thanks to the teaching system we offer. Our application is mainly aimed at:
* Musicians in general, from the newest to the most experienced.
* Music producers who promote and coordinate artists.
* Sound engineers who are responsible for designing and maintaining equipment and audio systems.
* Teachers who want to share their musical knowledge with those who are looking to learn.
* People focused on more technical roles.

<a Value proposal id="item4"></a>
### Value proposal
#### Videos to share your abilities
Our app offers the posibility to upload videos to help the user easily determine and show what they are good at and what they are looking for, this is made with the idea to help the persons that want to start a band to swiftly find the persons that they want. To complement the video we also allow to pair it with some text that you can use to put a description of your abilities and also add your cv, as an adittional option for people who are more experimented in working with a band or creating by themselves. All this is made with the objective of making easier to find persons and easier to connect with other people that look for your abilities.

#### Sell and buy objects or services
It also implements the ability to let the users post things that they want to sell or offer as a rent service; I want to clarify that the app will provide the ability to post and chat with the persos that offer the services and its made with that in mind, so currently we have not in our plans adding a method in which the users can exchange money.

#### Chat system
Because of that we also implement a messaging system that will help the users swiftly make contact with other persons to organize for buying something, selling or playing together. 

#### Search and filters for improved search
The search option will give the users the power to see only what they want, this tool will show results for things that are being sold, persons, and musicians with that abilities; if you don't want to see certain things, there also the option to filter the results, so you will only see the things that you select.

### Process description

We started this project with the intention of using the scrum methodology, but we did not organize ourselves in the best way, so we failed in some key aspects of this methodology, such as not being able to divide the tasks into small sections or holding daily meetings to see the progress of the project.

That's why we did not get stuck and decided to make a quick change, which was to start using the <b>Agile methodology<b>.

![image](https://github.com/Javier-de-Jesus-Ortiz-Miss/Proyecto-FIS/assets/142443060/18d7f023-843d-47d9-9f57-59848ec85531)

This methodology adapted perfectly to our needs and was very useful when organizing the distribution of roles and tasks that each of the members had to solve.

We first evaluate the best project ideas in a brainstorm. Afterwards, we organized ourselves to distribute the role that each of us was going to play in the development of the project. For this we distribute the tasks by points with equitable values ​​so that we work in equal parts. And finally, we held meetings from time to time virtually or in person to evaluate the progress we were making throughout the days, in order not to fall behind and finish the work on time.
