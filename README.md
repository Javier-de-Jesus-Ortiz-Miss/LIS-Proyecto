### Process description
We started this project with the intention of using the scrum methodology, but we did not organize ourselves in the best way, so we failed in some key aspects of this methodology, such as not being able to divide the tasks into small sections or holding daily meetings to see the progress of the project.

That's why we did not get stuck and decided to make a quick change, which was to start using the <b>Agile methodology<b>.

![image](https://github.com/Javier-de-Jesus-Ortiz-Miss/Proyecto-FIS/assets/142443060/18d7f023-843d-47d9-9f57-59848ec85531)

This methodology adapted perfectly to our needs and was very useful when organizing the distribution of roles and tasks that each of the members had to solve.

We first evaluate the best project ideas in a brainstorm. Afterwards, we organized ourselves to distribute the role that each of us was going to play in the development of the project. For this we distribute the tasks by points with equitable values ​​so that we work in equal parts. And finally, we held meetings from time to time virtually or in person to evaluate the progress we were making throughout the days, in order not to fall behind and finish the work on time.
