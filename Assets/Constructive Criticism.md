# Constructive Criticism

Throughout the semester, we considered it highly positive that what we learned in class could be applied directly to the project we were working on most of the time. Even when direct application wasn't possible, it still helped us to better understand the concepts covered. Therefore, the project played a crucial role in the development of the course, and without it, as a team, we wouldn't have been able to grasp the importance of most topics covered, especially in the process and its management. Similarly, working on the project alongside the topics covered posed initial challenges in organizing the team and the repository, as we lacked any prior knowledge. However, tackling it as we saw fit turned out to be beneficial in understanding our mistakes, why they shouldn't be made, and the consequences they carry. 
We consider that an area of opportunity is that we only have our work experience, and it could be very beneficial to hear from other teams about how their experience is similar to ours and why, or why they approached it differently and how. This would help us see how other classmates understood and applied what was covered in class, in addition to fostering interaction within the class.
