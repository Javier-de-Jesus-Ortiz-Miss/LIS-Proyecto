We chose our samble in the range of our public objective, being 18 the youngest and the oldest being 45, all of them being musicians. This was made in order to have a sample of people that properly represented our target audience. Users were briefed on the project's nature, with the following statement: “MusicHub es una aplicación de celular que busca conectar gente de la industria musical basándose en parámetros como ubicación, géneros y habilidades para que así puedan colaborar. De esta forma se busca impulsar la colaboración musical y brindar experiencias enriquecedoras a los usuarios” 
Then the Figma prototype of our final interfaces was provided, allowing them to sign up. When they were on the home screen, they were given the first objective “Sending a match request to a user” and were instructed to carry it out slowly so we could register the number of steps it took, in order to compare it to the ideal steps. We also recorded how many questions they made and if they achieved it. After the objective was met the user returned to the test screen to carry out the following task.
This was repeated for the following objectives: 
-edit profile description
-edit profile videos
-accept a match request
-search for a project
-create a project
These objectives were picked by the team in order the test out the functions that are fundamental and most unique to our app.
After the tests were over, we asked the user to answer a google forms which asked how intuitive they thought the app was, how professional did it look and a space for general feedback and recommendations.

# Interpretation of results

When conducting the tests, we aimed to have a range of ages, with our youngest user being 18 years old and the oldest being 45, which constitutes the age range of our target audience. Users were briefed on the project's nature, and a Figma prototype with their initial objective was provided.

* After conducting the tests, we found that 100% of the objectives presented to users were successfully completed.

* The average number of steps taken was 21, while the total ideal steps were 17.

* The average difference between the steps taken and the ideal steps was 4, indicating that the interfaces were intuitive for the users.

The primary questions that arose and commentaries regarding possible improvements centered around the objective of accepting a match request, this was also the objective which had the biggest difference between and ideal steps and the number of steps the users carried out, with a total difference of 17, (2.4 per user). As a potential improvement for the project, it would be beneficial to make the notification section more prominent, possibly having a tab dedicated to it, since the way it is now it isn’t obvious that notifications are in the same section as the chat and being able to easily accept match requests is fundamental to our app. Additionally, there wasn't a significant difference in results among participants of different ages, leading to the conclusion that the system is usable for individuals within those age ranges.
