# Interpretation of results

When conducting the tests, we aimed to have a range of ages, with our youngest user being 18 years old and the oldest being 45, which constitutes the age range of our target audience. Users were briefed on the project's nature, and a Figma prototype with their initial objective was provided.

* After conducting the tests, we found that 100% of the objectives presented to users were successfully completed.

* The average number of steps taken was 21, while the total ideal steps were 17.

* The average difference between the steps taken and the ideal steps was 4, indicating that the interfaces were intuitive for the users.

The primary questions that arose centered around the objective of accepting a match request, a recurring theme in several of the tests. As a potential improvement for the project, it would be beneficial to make the notification section more prominent. Additionally, there wasn't a significant difference in results among participants of different ages, leading to the conclusion that the system is usable for individuals within those age ranges.
