# Product evolution


The primary distinction in the project lies in our deliberate choices to prioritize the key requirements from the first delivery and identify which functions were truly essential for achieving our product's objectives. The most important functions that we discarded were: 

<ol>
  <li>The "rent/buy/sell equipment" section, while valuable, was not our central focus. </li>
  <li>The calendar feature was omitted because users can efficiently convey their availability through the chat function.</li>
  <li>We also decided against incorporating the ability to rate profiles, as we believe that the userÂ´s curriculum is the most reliable indicator of professionalism, and receiving low ratings could potentially demoralize amateurs.
</ol>

We also elaborated and modified all of the other requirements since we realized that most of them were vague and didn't offer a clear picture of what was needed in each of the functionalities.

With these refined requirements we continued the development process by making the use cases and  corresponding interfaces, as well as a use case diagram and user stories. All of this resulted in more clear and complete product, that has clear objectives and ways to fulfill them but without going overboard and being unmanageable.
